# Installing the Scaleway Driver

Scaleway is an unofficial driver for docker-machine. This means you need to install the driver for scaleway separately before you can use it.

1. Download the latest version of the driver from https://github.com/scaleway/docker-machine-driver-scaleway/releases
2. Extract the binary and place it in your PATH. 

For example on Linux you can do:

```bash
wget https://github.com/scaleway/docker-machine-driver-scaleway/releases/download/v1.6/docker-machine-driver-scaleway_1.6_linux_amd64.tar.gz
tar -xvf docker-machine-driver-scaleway_1.6_linux_amd64.tar.gz
chmod +x docker-machine-driver-scaleway
sudo mv docker-machine-driver-scaleway /usr/local/bin
```

| addSwap                  | Optionally add this much swap space to the machine as a factor of total RAM (`RAM * addSwap`).
