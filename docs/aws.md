# Provider Configuration for Amazon Web Services

In order to use ClusterODM with AWS:

* Create an Amazon Web Services Account
* Select a region to run your instances in - `us-east-2` typically has the cheapest instance costs.
* Create a security group in this region which allows inbound access from your ClusterODM master instance on TCP port 3000.
* Create an S3 bucket in this region to handle results. Don't configure this bucket to block public access.
* Select an AMI (machine image) to run - Ubuntu has a [handy AMI finder](https://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/locator/ec2/).
* Create an IAM account for ClusterODM to use, which has EC2 and S3 permissions.
* Create a ClusterODM configuration json file as below.

To optimise transfer speeds in large jobs, it's worth running ClusterODM in the same AWS region as your worker nodes.

## Using Spot Instances

This provider supports requesting [EC2 spot instances](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/spot/). Spot instances can save up to 90% of costs compared to
normal on-demand instance costs which makes AWS very competitive with other cloud providers. Spot instances are reliable enough
for long-running ODM jobs if the spot bid price is set high enough. It's common to request a bid price the same as
the on-demand instance cost - you'll always pay the current market price, not your bid price.

## Image Size Mapping

The `imageSizeMapping` dictionary dictates the instance parameters which will be requested by ClusterODM based on the number of images in the incoming task. The least powerful
instance able to process the requested number of images is always selected.

[EC2Instances.info](https://www.ec2instances.info) is a useful resource to help in selecting the appropriate instance type.

| Field     | Description                                                                                       |
|-----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| maxImages | The maximum number of images this instance size can handle.                                       |
| slug      | EC2 instance type to request (for example, `t3.medium`).                                          |
| storage   | Amount of storage to allocate to this instance's EBS root volume, in GB.                          |
| spotPrice | The maximum hourly price you're willing to bid for this instance (if spot instances are enabled). |
